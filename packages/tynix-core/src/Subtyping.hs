-- | Structural subtyping, consistency, and type reduction.
--
-- tynix prioritizes incremental adoption over maximum strictness. This module is
-- where that policy becomes concrete: `dynamic` participates through
-- consistency, records use width subtyping, and conditional types are reduced
-- structurally.
--
-- The key design tension in this module is "preserve as much information as we
-- can, but stay usable for ordinary Nix code". That leads to a few notable
-- choices:
--
-- * `dynamic` participates through consistency rather than ordinary subtyping.
-- * exact list shapes are preserved through `Vec`/`Matrix`/`Tensor` when the
--   source proves them,
-- * structural `List` views are still available when a consumer does not care
--   about exact shapes,
-- * numeric refinements such as `Range 0 10 Nat` and unit wrappers such as
--   `Unit "ms" (...)` are interpreted structurally instead of elaborated into
--   runtime contracts.
--
-- As a result, the relation implemented here is intentionally not a proof
-- system for dependent types. It is a pragmatic static approximation that keeps
-- useful facts alive for later phases.
