-- | Source comment directives that affect checker diagnostics.
--
-- These mirror the intent of TypeScript's line-level suppression comments but
-- are currently scoped to executable surfaces the checker understands well:
-- root expressions and `let` items. The parser attaches a directive when a
-- preceding `# @tynix-...` comment targets the next line of code.
data DiagnosticDirective

-- | A complete tynix file.
--
-- A file may contain type aliases, ambient declarations, and optionally a root
-- expression. Declaration-only files model `.d.tynix` surfaces, while ordinary
-- `.tynix` files typically contain all three sections in varying combinations.
data Program = Program

-- | Ambient declaration describing an existing `.nix` file.
--
-- This is the bridge that lets tynix add types to code it does not compile
-- itself. The declaration path is resolved relative to the file that declared
-- it, matching how Nix imports are usually written.
data AmbientDecl = AmbientDecl

-- | Term-level expressions preserved by the compiler.
--
-- The set is intentionally small and currently covers the subset needed to
-- prove the architecture: records, lambdas, applications, imports, selections,
-- lists, local bindings, infix numeric addition, and explicit type assertions.
--
-- 'ECast' models TypeScript-style `expr as Type` assertions. The checker treats
-- them as an explicit user-directed boundary: casts may widen, narrow, or cross
-- a gradual boundary, but they still remain type-only syntax and are erased
-- back to plain `.nix`.

    ESelectOr Expr [SelectStep] Expr
  | -- | `<nixpkgs>`-style lookup path.
    ESearchPath FilePath
  | -- | Path literal containing antiquotations, such as `./${name}.nix`. Text
    -- segments keep the literal spelling, including the leading `./`, `/`,
    -- or `~/`.
    EPathInterp [StringPart]
  | -- | Source location wrapper. The parser attaches these so the checker can
    -- report span-accurate diagnostics; 'stripLocations' removes them for
    -- consumers that compare trees structurally.
    ELoc SrcSpan Expr
  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- | A half-open source region as 0-based character offsets into the file.
--
-- The end offset may include trailing layout consumed by the lexer; consumers
-- converting to line/column positions trim it against the source text.

-- antiquoted @${expr}@ expression.
data StringPart

    -- indentation to strip from the literal lines only.
    StrEscape Char
  | StrExpr Expr
  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- | Binary operators preserved by the compiler.
--
-- The set mirrors the executable Nix surface tynix understands: numeric
-- arithmetic, list concatenation, structural equality, ordered comparisons,
-- and short-circuiting boolean connectives. Each operator is erased back to

  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- | Record attributes inside an attribute set.
--
-- `inherit` is modeled explicitly so the checker can resolve inherited names
-- instead of flattening them away during parsing.
data AttrItem

  | AttrInherit [Name]
  | -- | `inherit (source) a b;`
